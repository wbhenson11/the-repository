        <div><h3>Statement No. 151225.2</h3></div>
        <div><h4>About death and dying. Statement submitted December 15th, 2025, by a priest, to Sibling.</h4></div>
        <div><p><b>Written Statement</b></p></div>
        <div><p>The second uncanny thing is something that happens repeatedly for me, and it is generally around the 
        death of a parishioner. When someone is at that point you get a sense that their death is eminent whether you’re 
        with them or not I’ve learned to listen to that prompting and trust it because when I don’t inevitably, I don’t 
        show up when someone dies, and I miss the opportunity for end of life care. I’ve spoken to many other ministers 
        and end of life nurses and we all kind of report the same thing that when you walk with somebody near death, 
        you’re walking in this liminal space that gives you access to something more than just the normal rational 
        understandable world. It connects you to whatever it is that comes next and gives you a sense that otherwise 
        doesn’t exist in us.</p></div>

        <div><p>   As this was submitted by a family member, neither I nor my Brother could in good conscience declare scholarly neutrality.
<br>
           This could be attributed to confirmation bias without numbers, but for this to happen enough to be confirmed for that, I think, is 
           implausible without something more influencing experiences. Also, given that it was mentioned that others have similar experiences, 
           I will be making similar statements an open investigation.
