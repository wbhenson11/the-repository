First off, apologies for some of the commit and file names. I was sleep deprived and frustrated with myself for reasons other than the project, and I don't feel like going back through and changing everything or restarting on a new repository.

Second off, this project was named before I knew I'd make the website on Github. 
<br>
With that out of the way...
