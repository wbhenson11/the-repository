First off, apologies for some of the commit and file names. I was sleep deprived and frustrated with myself for reasons other than the project, and now I don't feel like going back through and changing the stylesheet reference on every page or restarting on a new repository.

<br>
Second off, this project was named before I knew I'd make the website on Github. 
<br>
<br>
With that out of the way...

>### FAQs
>**Where is the contact form to submit questions?** There is none yet! One may be implemented in the future, but we currently are not making any plans on that front. However, we've some questions that may be asked can be answered below. <br>
>**Why are there runes in your logo?** It looks cool. <br>
>**Why is your logo an eye?** It looks cool. Also, see the 'About' page for the story. <br>
>**What do the titles in your logo mean?** They represent the main areas of knowledge that interest us, although 'Unbelievable', our primary focus, is not quite the right word and 'Unknowable' isn't even a pipe dream. <br>
>**What do you mean by 'Unbelievable'?** Unbelievable represents things, like statistical anomalies, miracles, or undocumented species, that are more easily brushed off as made-up (which, often, is true). However, in some cases the former, at least, is true. That is why we are researching it - because, although it may not be credible, and it is certainly anecdotal, we think that the occasions where the Unbelievable occurs are worth documenting.
