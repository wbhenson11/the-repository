             <b>What is the Repository?</b><br>
             The Repository is a project dedicated to collecting and document the stories of people's experiences that could be explained 
             by the supernatural. The repository is meant to be a resource for practical study. Eventually the Repository hopes to create 
             a network of investigators and researchers documenting and organizing these stories.

             <b>Who created the Repository?</b><br>
             For our privacy, the brother & sibling team behind the Repository have elected not to share our actual identities at this time. 
             Depending on how much this project grows, we may re-evaluate this decision later.
