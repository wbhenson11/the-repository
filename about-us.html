             <b>What is the Repository?</b><br>
             The Repository is a project dedicated to collecting and document the stories of people's experiences that could be explained 
             by the supernatural. The repository is meant to be a resource for practical study. Eventually the Repository hopes to create 
             a network of investigators and researchers documenting and organizing these stories.
<br><br>
             <b>Who created the Repository?</b><br>
             For our privacy, the brother & sibling team behind the Repository have elected not to share our actual identities at this time. 
             Depending on how much this project grows, we may re-evaluate this decision later.
<br><br>
             <b>How do you collect your stories?</b><br>
             Currently, the Repository is collecting stories from families, friends, acquaintances, and just about anyone else we meet with 
             a tale to tell. We don't at the moment have the time and resources to accept stories from the internet, especially given the 
             possibility of trolling. 
<br><br>
             <b>Do you believe these stories?</b><br>
             I can't speak for my brother, but I'm open to the possibility of them being true. However, the Repository as an organization 
             does not want to campaign either way. Our goal is to collect information. For each story, we will make whatever follow-up is 
             reasonable and attach the results to the statement itself. This follow up will include a brief survey regarding the source's 
             mental state at the time of the experience and relevant medical history.
<br><br>
             <b>Why did you make the Repository?</b><br>
             The supernatural has always fascinated me. In fact, one of my dreams as a kid was to travel the world and talk to people who 
             supposedly had supernatural ties. I've scaled down that dream a bit, but it lives on in this project. What inspired me to 
             actually do something about this dream was being introduced to The Magnus Archives through the band, The Mechanisms. It gave me 
             the idea to create a real version as a way of fulfilling at least one of my childhood dreams, and is also the reason that our 
             logo is eye-shaped. I then convinced my brother to join me, since he has more opportunities to meet people.
<br><br>
             <b>I have information that may be relevant to the story.</b><br>
             A form will be implemented in the future.
